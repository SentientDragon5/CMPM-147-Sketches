				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment I familiarized myself with P5js and how to make objects move.</p>
				<img src="./img/bubbles.jpg" alt="https://www.pickpik.com/bubbles-abstract-blue-science-abstraction-backgrounds-159200">
				<p>I based my experiment off of the idea of bubbles floating in water.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I added a gradient in the background that is drawn with strokes that go for each row. The bubbles are a class that is instanced.</p>
				<p>At first, a group of bubbles is instanced, then bubbles are randomly spawned thereafter.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was not too challenging, but I wanted to add additional functionalities that did not end up working.</p>
				<p>P5js is an interesting tool. I had mistook its purpose.</p>
